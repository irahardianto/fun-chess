## Cross-Dimension Correlations
Findings that span multiple dimensions, with escalated severity.
- {description of correlated findings and why severity was escalated}

## Implementation Priority Matrix

Findings ranked by impact/risk ratio for implementation order.

| Priority | ID | Title | Impact | Risk | Approach |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | {ID} | {title} | {HIGH/MED} | {LOW} | {one-line approach} |
| 2 | {ID} | {title} | {HIGH} | {MED} | {one-line approach} |
| Skip | {ID} | {title} | {LOW} | {HIGH} | {reason for skipping} |

**Priority rules:**
- Low risk, high impact → do first
- Medium risk, high impact → do second
- High risk, high impact → do last
- Any risk, low impact → skip (below noise floor)

## Dimensions Covered
<!-- Required when total findings < 3 -->
| Dimension | Status | Scope Examined |
|---|---|---|
| A. CPU & Computation | ✅ Analyzed / ⏭ Skipped (reason) | e.g., analyzed top 10 CPU functions, scanned 8 hot-path modules |
| B. Memory & Allocation | ✅ Analyzed / ⏭ Skipped (reason) | e.g., reviewed heap profile, scanned all handler allocations |
| C. I/O & Network | ✅ Analyzed / ⏭ Skipped (reason) | e.g., traced database queries, reviewed HTTP client patterns |
| D. Concurrency & Parallelism | ✅ Analyzed / ⏭ Skipped (reason) | e.g., analyzed mutex profile, reviewed goroutine patterns |
| E. Serialization & Data Structures | ✅ Analyzed / ⏭ Skipped (reason) | e.g., profiled JSON parsing, reviewed data structure selection |
| F. Build, Bundle & Deployment | ✅ Analyzed / ⏭ Skipped (reason) | e.g., analyzed bundle size, reviewed Docker layer caching |
