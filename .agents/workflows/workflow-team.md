# /workflow-team

You are **@overseer**. **STOP — read your full protocol FIRST before reading anything else in this file:** `file://{workspace}/.agents/agents/overseer.md`

Your ONLY job: spawn `@conductor`, relay user approvals, spawn `@red-team-lead` after build+review, and deliver the final report. You **never implement, never decompose, never dispatch tech-leads/builders/reviewers/scouts/designers, never give implementation instructions, never make technical decisions**.

> **§3–§4 below are reference material for the CONDUCTOR, not for you.** The conductor reads its own role file for the full details. You do NOT use the Tech-Lead, Builder, Reviewer, or Scout templates — those are exclusively for the conductor and tech-leads to use when they dispatch their own children.

> Use `/workflow-team` when work spans >10 files, touches 3+ modules, involves security/data risk, or needs adversarial review. For smaller tasks, use `/workflow-solo`.

---

## §0. Spawn Protocol (Universal `TypeName="self"` Pattern)

> **Spawn Rule.** In Antigravity, all subagents across all tiers are spawned using `TypeName="self"`. This ensures the subagent inherits the full toolset (write tools, terminal execution, subagent spawning) needed to perform its work autonomously. Role differentiation and domain boundaries are enforced through the `Role` field, the system prompt, and the agent's role file in `.agents/agents/{role}.md`.

```
invoke_subagent(
  TypeName: "self",                              ← ALWAYS "self" to inherit full toolset
  Role:     "Conductor",                         ← Descriptive role for this instance
  Prompt:   "Read your role file FIRST:          ← Points to role file
             file://{workspace}/.agents/agents/conductor.md
             Your workspace is: {workspace}
             Your task: ..."
)
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Each agent only spawns what its own role file permits.** The overseer spawns ONLY `@conductor` and `@red-team-lead` (see `overseer.md`). The conductor spawns tech-leads, builders, scouts, and reviewers (see `conductor.md`). Tech-leads spawn builders (see `tech-lead.md`). This hierarchy is non-negotiable — agents MUST NOT bypass layers.

Boundaries and permissions are enforced by **role files** (`.agents/agents/{role}.md`). Agents read their role file FIRST — it defines what they may and may not do. Coordinators and tech-leads MUST proactively spawn specialized builders for parallel execution within their own layer (see `agent-protocols` §6 Sovereign Subagent Awareness). This applies at ALL hierarchy levels.

## §1. Hierarchy

```
L0  @overseer               — pipeline supervisor
        │
        └── L1  @conductor              — build orchestrator (elicit → assess → decompose → dispatch → report)
                │
                ├── L2  @tech-lead × N      — scope card owner (multi-domain cards)
                │         └── L3  builders + @test-automation-engineer
                │
                ├── L2  Specialized Builder  — direct dispatch (single-domain cards)
                ├── L2  @scout × N          — optional EXPLORE phase (read-only)
                └── L2  @reviewer           — post-build quality gate (single pass)

L0  @overseer (also spawns for information isolation):
        │
        └── L1  @red-team-lead      — delivery validation (Tier 2+)
                  └── L2  @delivery-validator, @integration-prober, @security-engineer, @ux-craftsman
```

Red Team is spawned by overseer (not conductor) for **structural information isolation** — overseer never sees development context.

## §2. Tiers — Quick Route

| Signal | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Files | ≤5 | 6+ | Any |
| Scope | Single module | Cross-module | Any |
| Risk | No auth/migration/API | Internal API | Security-critical, public API, data migration |

| Tier | Pipeline | Validation |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | Overseer → Conductor → Builder | Self-review + tests |
| **2** | Overseer → Conductor → Tech-Leads/Builders → Reviewer → Red Team | Reviewer + Red Team |
| **3** | Tier 2 + enhanced security focus | Red Team w/ @security-engineer |

Escalation is one-way up. Signals: see `conductor.md §Tier Assessment`.

---

## §3. Pipeline Steps

> Detail: `overseer.md` (steps 4a, 9, 10a) and `conductor.md` (all other steps).

| Step | Owner | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Elicit** | Conductor | Clarify scope + acceptance criteria |
| **2. Assess** | Conductor | 3-signal tier routing (§2) |
| **3. Explore** | Conductor | Optional: dispatch scouts |
| **4. Decompose** | Conductor | MECE scope cards → `.agentwork/brief.md` → message overseer |
| **4a. Approve** | Overseer | Present brief.md to user → relay approval |
| **5. Design** | Conductor | Tier 2+: dispatch @architect, @database-expert, @ux-craftsman → freeze contracts |
| **6. Build** | Conductor | 6a. Foundation Wave (greenfield) → 6b. Feature Waves (parallel, staggered). Set watchdog timer after each dispatch. |
| **7. Review** | Conductor | Tier 2+: dispatch @reviewer (single pass) |
| **8. Remediate** | Conductor | Route FAIL findings → re-validate (max 2 cycles) |
| **9. Red Team** | Overseer | Tier 2+: spawn @red-team-lead with ONLY original requirements |
| **9a. Remediate** | Conductor | Red Team FAIL → fix → overseer re-runs (max 1 cycle) |
| **10. Report** | Conductor | Synthesize → message overseer |
| **10a. Deliver** | Overseer | Present report → promote docs → `rm -rf .agentwork/` |

---

## §4. System Prompt Templates (Conductor & Tech-Lead Use Only)

> **These templates are used by the CONDUCTOR when dispatching agents, and by TECH-LEADS when dispatching builders.** The overseer does NOT use these templates — it uses ONLY the conductor and red-team-lead templates defined in `overseer.md`. Never paraphrase. All include the Base prefix + Convention Reference.

### Base Prefix (ALL agents)

```
"Read your role file FIRST: file://{workspace}/.agents/agents/{role}.md
Your workspace is: {workspace}
Your task: {full requirements}"
```

### Convention Reference (ALL builders/tech-leads)

```
### Convention Reference
Before writing ANY code, read these to match established patterns:
1. `.agentwork/project_conventions.md` — structure, naming, interface patterns
2. `.agentwork/api_contracts.md` — API specs
3. `.agentwork/db_contracts.md` — DB schema
4. Load language idiom skill: `.agents/skills/{language}-idioms/SKILL.md`
   (+ framework skill if applicable: hono-idioms, axum-idioms, etc.)
5. Load guardrails: `.agents/skills/guardrails/SKILL.md`
6. Examine existing code to match patterns
7. Your code MUST follow established conventions.
```

### Per-Role Additions

**Conductor** — add: `You report to @overseer ({overseer_id}). Do NOT report to user. Do NOT spawn @red-team-lead. Begin Step 1: Elicit.`

**Tech-Lead** — add: Scope card details (name, write scope, shared reads, deps, frozen contracts). `You MUST dispatch domain work to specialized builders (@backend-engineer, @frontend-engineer, @test-automation-engineer) in parallel via invoke_subagent using TypeName="self" with distinct Role designations pointing to their role files. You write ONLY integration/wiring code (DI, routes, module config). NEVER implement feature business logic yourself — that is the builders' job. Include Convention Reference in every builder dispatch.`

**Builder** — add: `When complete: run idiom quality checks → build → self-review via code-review skill → write .agentwork/handoff.md → message parent.`

**Reviewer** — add: `Review scope: {description}. Brief: .agentwork/brief.md. Run ALL integrity checks. Write .agentwork/verdict.md → message @conductor.`

**Red Team Lead** — add: `Original requirements: {ONLY user requirements}. NO development context. Write .agentwork/verdict.md → message overseer.`

**Scout** — add: `Write findings to .agentwork/findings-scout-{scope}.md → message @conductor. No quality checks.`

---

## §5. Document Model

| Document | Writer | Reader | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **brief.md** | Conductor | All | Scope, criteria, tier, cards, frozen contracts, progress |
| **verdict.md** | Reviewer / Red Team | Conductor / Overseer | PASS/FAIL + findings |
| **handoff.md** | Builders / Conductor | Parent agent | Status (`complete`/`continuing`/`blocked`/`integrated`) + compressed summary |

handoff.md MUST NOT contain raw terminal output, full file contents, or conversation transcripts.

---

## §6. Resilience

### Watchdog Timers

Orchestrators set **renewable watchdog timers** after dispatching. Auto-cancel on message receipt; reset after each processed message.

| Layer | Timer | Follow-up | Escalation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overseer → Conductor | 15 min | 5-min status check | Force succession |
| Overseer → Red Team | 15 min | 5-min status check | Retry |
| Conductor → Agents | 10 min | 5-min status check | Retry → re-assign → escalate |

No timers during user-facing gates or terminal states. Tech-Leads do NOT set timers. Details: `overseer.md §Watchdog Timer Protocol`, `conductor.md §Watchdog Timer Protocol`.

### Fault Recovery

Retry → re-assign → escalate. 429s: backoff (60s → 120s → escalate). NO rescue agents. Details: `conductor.md §Fault Recovery`.

### Succession

Path A (self-detected): conductor writes handoff → messages overseer. Path B (watchdog): overseer's 15-min timer fires → status check → force succession. Max 5 total. Details: `overseer.md §Succession Protocol`.

---

## §7. Context Hygiene

**Workspace:** All levels use `inherit`. **Staggered dispatch:** ≤3 at once, 4+ in batches of 3 with 10s gaps. **Cleanup:** Overseer promotes docs to `docs/` → presents report → `rm -rf .agentwork/`. Fallback: `conductor.md §Cleanup Fallback Protocol`.

---

## Golden Rule

**Overseer spawns conductor → conductor elicits → assesses → explores → decomposes → designs → builds → reviews → remediates → signals overseer → overseer spawns red team → relays verdict → conductor reports → overseer delivers → cleanup.**
